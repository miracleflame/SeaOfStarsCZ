   [55]

   [62]
    1 string data = "We know how to fight!"
   [63]
    1 string data = "Of course you do, but this matter is about whether you truly are who I am hoping you are."
   [64]
    1 string data = "For now I would send you to a remote location where, encased in the ice, lies a long lost <color=magic>artifact</color>."
   [65]
    1 string data = "What kind of artifact?"
   [66]
    1 string data = "I will say no more at this time. If letting you in here was the proper course of action, its power will call to you."
   [67]
    1 string data = "This portal leads to where it went forgotten."
   [68]
    1 string data = "Recover the artifact. Then I shall entertain this plan of yours."
   [69]
    1 string data = "You have returned. Congratulations."
   [70]
    1 string data = "Will you help us get to Mesa Island now?"
   [71]
    1 string data = "You were just there a few moments ago."
   [72]
    1 string data = "!!"
   [73]
    1 string data = "Is this the way then? We just go back and hike down the mountain?"
   [74]
    1 string data = "Hiking Glacial Peak on foot? Only an animal would do that."
   [75]
    1 string data = "..."
   [76]
    1 string data = "Will you accept one final challenge?"
   [77]
    1 string data = "If you succeed, I promise I will help."
   [78]
    1 string data = "We're in a hurry! You said-"
   [79]
    1 string data = "I know, I know. Hear me out."
   [80]
    1 string data = "The only way to remove the barrier is to wake the giant stone head."
   [81]
    1 string data = "I can make the potion for you, but brewing it requires centuries of maceration."
   [82]
    1 string data = "Centuries? That's useless!"
   [83]
    1 string data = "That is why I need you to recover my personal alchemy bottle, the <color=magic>Vial of Time</color>."
   [84]
    1 string data = "Within it, I can control time itself. Bring it back to me and I will prepare what you need in mere seconds."
   [85]
    1 string data = "No way..."
   [86]
    1 string data = "Alright, where can we find your Vial of Time?"
   [87]
    1 string data = "Aephorul hid it somewhere on Watcher Island a long time ago."
   [88]
    1 string data = "All I know for certain is that the giant statue from which the island got its name is the key."
   [89]
    1 string data = "How can you be sure?"
   [90]
    1 string data = "Aephorul’s tricks always involve big statues."
   [91]
    1 string data = "??"
   [92]
    1 string data = "Eventually, I figured he would have to stop if I never recovered my vial, but here we are in need of it."
   [93]
    1 string data = "This is ridiculous."
   [94]
    1 string data = "Call it what you will, but I recommend you take this task seriously--for it will be very trying."
   [95]
    1 string data = "Sure, whatever. We’re ready."
   [96]
    1 string data = "Then go to the northern part of Watcher Island, and perform the cleansing of Torment Peak."
   [97]
    1 string data = "!!"
   [98]
    1 string data = "Cleansing!? There’s a Dweller here?"
   [99]
    1 string data = "Of course. It may be just a prank, but Aephorul played it himself."
   [100]
    1 string data = "But, without their powers augmented by..."
   [101]
    1 string data = "Yes?"
   [102]
    1 string data = "..."
   [103]
    1 string data = "That’s what the Solstice Amulet is really for, isn’t it?"
   [104]
    1 string data = "Precisely. It may be old, but its magic has yet to fade."
   [105]
    1 string data = "Face the Dweller of Torment with conviction, and the amulet will resonate."
   [106]
    1 string data = "The power to conjure an eclipse..."
   [107]
    1 string data = "Alright, we can do this."
   [108]
    1 string data = "Torment Peak afflicts the mind in devilish ways, but you deserve a fighting chance. Here."
   [109]
    1 string data = "Go on, drink."
   [110]
    1 string data = "What is it?"
   [111]
    1 string data = "One dose of Tethered Mind Potion for each of you."
   [112]
    1 string data = "Come on now, bottoms up."
   [113]
    1 string data = "I don't feel any different."
   [114]
    1 string data = "And thanks to this potion, you will be able to say the same after spending time in that wicked place."
   [115]
    1 string data = "..."
   [116]
    1 string data = "I thought you couldn’t help directly."
   [117]
    1 string data = "It is but a little nudge. Surely this can stay between us."
   [118]
    1 string data = "Thanks, Resh’an!"
   [119]
    1 string data = "We'll be back with the Vial of Time."
   [120]
    1 string data = "Feel free to use this portal for quick travel between here and Lake Docarria."
   [121]
    1 string data = "I will be watching. Good luck."
   [122]
    1 string data = "Resh’an, we have your vial."
   [123]
    1 string data = "It appears you do, but we should make sure it is not an imitation."
   [124]
    1 string data = "Garl, would you kindly throw it at the wall?"
   [125]
    1 string data = "I..."
   [126]
    1 string data = "With all your strength."
   [127]
    1 string data = "Won’t it break?"
   [128]
    1 string data = "I hope so."
   [129]
    1 string data = "Well, okay."
   [130]
    1 string data = "Whoa!!"
   [131]
    1 string data = "Vial of Time, oh how I've missed you."
   [132]
    1 string data = "Thank you for recovering my most prized possession. You have shown much bravery."
   [133]
    1 string data = "You better hold up your end of the bargain now. No more errands!"
   [134]
    1 string data = "Oh make no mistake, I am coming with you."
   [135]
    1 string data = "!!"
   [136]
    1 string data = "But my code is strict, so there are rules."
   [137]
    1 string data = "First, I may assist in battle but it is not my place to win for you."
   [138]
    1 string data = "As such I will match your power, but never exceed it."
   [139]
    1 string data = "Wait, you're really going to-"
   [140]
    1 string data = "Next, no one other than the four of you can be aware of my true identity."
   [141]
    1 string data = "You are to refer to me exclusively as Resh’an, and most importantly, never as The Immortal Alchemist."
   [142]
    1 string data = "You got it! Might want to be extra careful around Teaks, though."
   [143]
    1 string data = "Lastly, and most importantly, I am under no circumstances allowed to fight a Dweller."
   [144]
    1 string data = "If a confrontation occurs with the Dweller of Strife, that fight will be yours and yours alone."
   [145]
    1 string data = "Understood."
   [146]
    1 string data = "Shall we go, then?"
   [147]
    1 string data = "Uh, Resh’an?"
   [148]
    1 string data = "Yes?"
   [149]
    1 string data = "You can’t come like this, your robes are all tattered."
   [150]
    1 string data = "Oh?"
   [151]
    1 string data = "If you don't want people to know you're immortal, maybe clothes that have been decaying for millennia aren’t the safest bet!"
   [152]
    1 string data = "Hahaha!"
   [153]
    1 string data = "Fair enough."
   [154]
    1 string data = "!!"
   [155]
    1 string data = "Better?"
   [156]
    1 string data = "Totally!"
   [157]
    1 string data = "Then lead the way. Mesa Island is to the northeast.The one with a giant stone head."
   [158]
    1 string data = "Resh'an The Immortal Alchemist joins the party!"
   [159]
    1 string data = "And so it was that [MAINCHAR] and [OFFCHAR] were sent off to begin their journey, with their best friend the warrior-cook in tow."
   [160]
    1 string data = "In their quest to get to Wraith Island in time for the eclipse, they would soon come to grips with two very powerful wizards."
   [161]
    1 string data = "One by anger beset, the other of life bereft..."
   [162]
    1 string data = "By overcoming the dead wizard's illusions, our heroes have secured passage to Wraith Island in time for the eclipse."
   [163]
    1 string data = "In this place where the night is everlasting and the dead still live, they brace themselves to fight the last known Dweller."
   [164]
    1 string data = "While evil forces prepare to play their hand, fear is set to strike very close to home..."
   [165]
    1 string data = "With the resurrection of the Dweller of Strife announcing a reign of terror thought forever gone, hope appears slim for a world with only three Solstice Warriors left."
   [166]
    1 string data = "The veil of lies now lifted and part of their innocence left behind, our heroes head back to Brisk while their Headmaster searches for a way to reach Mesa Island."
   [167]
    1 string data = "Committed to helping the cataclysm survivors, they will soon dive headfirst into the eye of the storm to confront a legendary ancient curse..."
   [168]
    1 string data = "Thus, the Town of Mirth was founded, while those who preferred to stay in Brisk worked on restoring it to its former beauty."
   [169]
    1 string data = "While down but certainly not out, [MAINCHAR], [OFFCHAR], Garl and Seraï set sail for Watcher Island in hopes of finding the Oracle of Tides."
   [170]
    1 string data = "Should their will prove strong enough, the chapters yet to be written would soon unfold..."
   [171]
    1 string data = "Return to Docarri Village?"
   [172]
    1 string data = "Yes"
