      "It is indeed the dead you hear, for the necromancer lives somewhere near.",

      "This has to be it.",
      "Okay, she really does have style!",
      "Stay vigilant. Romaya might be home.",
      "On that, you would be correct.",
      "Whatever brought you here, I believe that is far enough.",
      "Our friend's life is in danger. We need a soul stone.",
      "We're going in no matter what.",
      "Then we are at an impasse, for I am bound to serve the mistress in undeath.",
      "Serve? She resurrected you from your ashes?",
      "Who are you?",
      "A wandering spirit, forever lost in longing...",
      "Generations ago, I was known as <color=good>Duke Aventry</color>. That is all I can remember.",
      "I am prisoner to a never-ending fugue state, with ephemeral memories of the good people of Lucent as my only company...",
      "But I digress. The spectral chains that bind me to the mistress beckon.",
      "Please understand this is not of my own volition. En garde!",
      "You fight with spirit and conviction.",
      "I believe the mistress would rather not lose her bodyguard. You may pass.",

      "??",

      "Here, let me show you.",
      "That footing really helps. Thanks for the insight!",
      "As expected, you are a natural.",
      "Safe journeys, young ones.",
      "You have returned with a soul stone. Quite impressive, though I suppose this means the mistress will be quite upset with me.",
      "The exit path is to the right. You will have to make good use of your Graplou.",
      "I hope you can get to your friend in time.",

      "Breathe in and don't be tense, I shall take you back to the entrance.",
      "Greetings, I am the keeper of this graveyard. ",
      "I suggest you turn back as soon as possible, for the mistress of the place is not fond of company.",
      "You should heed my words, young adventurers.",
      "To anger the mistress is to put oneself in danger.",
      "I... don't mind the cold...",

      "A journal? It seems like it belongs to the mistress, but these entries have my handwriting...",
      "Ah, yes... I had forgotten all about the estate...",
