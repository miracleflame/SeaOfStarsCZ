   [111]
    1 string data = "How much time do we have?"
   [112]
    1 string data = "Barely enough, and it'll be dangerous."
   [113]
    1 string data = "If we're lucky, the master will be away and we can grab a soul stone unnoticed."
   [114]
    1 string data = "How bad could it be? We've been trained to fight death magic."
   [115]
    1 string data = "No doubt, but Romaya is one of the <color=bad>Three Sisters</color>. And the most formidable one of the bunch, too."
   [116]
    1 string data = "As to whether or not that makes her more powerful than Solstice Warriors, I hope we won't have to find out."
   [117]
    1 string data = "How can we get there?"
   [118]
    1 string data = "The <color=good>Ferryman</color>, east of Lucent. If we play our cards right, he'll take us across the bog."

   [120]
    1 string data = "Good. Thanks for... Hey, what's your name, by the way?"

   [133]
    1 string data = "Might as well get comfortable, this could take a while."
   [134]
    1 string data = "Haha! And then you were all, “But if I don't get a sword, how will I do backflips?”"
   [135]
    1 string data = "You're one to talk with your “Bulwark of the innocents” thing, I'm so glad you gave that up."
   [136]
    1 string data = "To be fair, we did help a bunch of people already."
   [137]
    1 string data = "Sure, there's just no need to act all grand about it."
   [138]
    1 string data = "“If we're ever to ascend, as the solar one I will be the spark!”"
   [139]
    1 string data = "Oh, come on! I was ten!"
   [140]
    1 string data = "Valere, something happened to me in the woods, when he got mind controlled..."
   [141]
    1 string data = "Hmm?"
   [142]
    1 string data = "I don't understand it, it was like a floodgate opened in the pit of my stomach."
   [143]
    1 string data = "Like when we were first learning magic?"
   [144]
    1 string data = "Sort of, but... way, way stronger."
   [145]
    1 string data = "Do you think it was the Dweller?"
   [146]
    1 string data = "No, it didn't feel evil, or even bad."
   [147]
    1 string data = "It felt like a response to seeing Garl in danger..."
   [148]
    1 string data = "But I couldn't let it in, I feared it would overwhelm me."
   [149]
    1 string data = "..."
   [150]
    1 string data = "Maybe I could have helped him, but I..."
   [151]
    1 string data = "And if Seraï hadn't showed up..."
   [152]
    1 string data = "Zale, we're all safe now. That's all that matters."
   [153]
    1 string data = "...I think that was my prophecy, I think I missed the window."
   [154]
    1 string data = "What do you mean?"
   [155]
    1 string data = "The Elder Mist, he told me I had potential but first needed to “stare at the night inside of me.”"
   [156]
    1 string data = "I think this is what he meant... The thought of losing a loved one."
   [157]
    1 string data = "I felt the power, but I couldn't actualize it..."
   [158]
    1 string data = "I wouldn't overthink it. Garl is safe, and for all we know, most prophecies fail to come true."
   [159]
    1 string data = "Aren't you curious about yours?"
   [160]
    1 string data = "Mine? He said I might be able to “create paths on water.” What does that even mean?"
   [161]
    1 string data = "Yeah, talk about cryptic..."
   [162]
    1 string data = "The way I look at it, it's either going to happen, or not, no matter how much sleep I lose over it."
   [163]
    1 string data = "You have such a relaxed outlook. Sometimes I wish I was born on the winter solstice, too."
   [164]
    1 string data = "Haha! You and Erlina are definitely more feisty."
   [165]
    1 string data = "I suppose you and I even each other out, in a way."
   [166]
    1 string data = "It's why we make a good team!"
   [167]
    1 string data = "I guess, it's just..."
   [168]
    1 string data = "Or maybe it's because stealing my live mana helps you show off?"
   [169]
    1 string data = "Haha! Forget it, you do it way more than I do!"
   [170]
    1 string data = "Hggnn..."

   [176]
    1 string data = "You're safe now, buddy. Don't worry about it."
   [177]
    1 string data = "What happened?"
   [178]
    1 string data = "After we tried to save the villager, the Dweller sang again, and..."
   [179]
    1 string data = "Whoa! You mean she could teleport?"
   [180]
    1 string data = "By carving magic gates out of thin air, somehow."
   [181]
    1 string data = "This is too much! Hopefully we'll meet her again, I've GOT to see that!"
   [182]
    1 string data = "Welcome to the First Stage of Grief! Please have a seat, and I will be right over."
   [183]

   [188]
    1 string data = "The eclipse is upon us, I should provide your briefing."

    1 string data = "Oh, that happened already!"
   [191]
    1 string data = "Excuse me?"

   [204]
    1 string data = "Hey, I can fight, and I'm a good support!"
   [205]
    1 string data = "Dwellers are impervious to all but solstice magic. Your mere presence would be a liability."

    1 string data = "Well, the Elder Mist gave me special permission!"
   [207]
    1 string data = "What?"
