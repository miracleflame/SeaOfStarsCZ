    1 string data = "It's Malkomud, the earth elemental wizard..."
   [10]
    1 string data = "We're just a peaceful little outpost, taking care of the mine's wind tunnels."

    1 string data = "It's our job, it is, to keep them unobstructed, so that the wind can play the melody for <color=bad>The Sleeper</color>."

   [15]
    1 string data = "What's more, he clogged the tunnel powering the great elevator's windmill, so we can't even go to <color=location>Brisk</color> to ask for help..."
   [16]
    1 string data = "If this continues, Malkomud's minions will start pouring out of the mines, and..."
   [17]
    1 string data = "And..."
   [18]
    1 string data = "It's okay, we'll see what we can do. Anything else you can tell us?"
   [19]

   [20]

   [45]
    1 string data = "We're looking for a crew of adventurers who might help us sail to another island."
   [46]
    1 string data = "Oh! In that case, you will want to visit the Port Town of Brisk!"
   [47]
    1 string data = "Feel free to use the big lift to the south. You're the ones who fixed it, after all."
   [48]
    1 string data = "A port town, surely we can find a ship there!"
   [49]
    1 string data = "It's got all sorts of people. You're bound to find what you're looking for."
   [50]
    1 string data = "Oh, I can't wait, there might even be a tavern!"
   [51]
    1 string data = "Oh, the irony..."
   [52]
    1 string data = "What's the matter?"
   [53]
    1 string data = "I need my tools to fix this busted door, but they're in the back room, and I can't get through!"
   [54]
    1 string data = "The lever on the other side seems to work fine though. If only there was another way to enter..."
   [55]
    1 string data = "Hey, good job, kid!"
   [56]
    1 string data = "Oh, and you didn't even open my chests? Very admirable! "
   [57]
    1 string data = "But you were a great help. Please help yourself to their contents."
   [58]
    1 string data = "Were my chests okay?"
   [59]
    1 string data = "..."
   [60]
    1 string data = "Haha, just kidding! It's the least I could offer as payment."
   [61]
    1 string data = "Thanks for the help!"
   [62]
    1 string data = "The water pump stopped functioning after Malkomud clogged the wind tunnels. There's no more water in the well!"
   [63]
    1 string data = "I really want to take a bath! Will you go in the mines to help?"
   [64]
    1 string data = "I really want to take a bath!"
   [65]
    1 string data = "The pump is in there, probably just needs to be restarted..."
   [66]
    1 string data = "Would you mind going?"
   [67]
    1 string data = "Hey, you did it!"
   [68]
    1 string data = "Thanks, I really needed that. Here, for your troubles."
   [69]
    1 string data = "Welcome to the Sleepy Mason! Would you like to rest in our geothermal room?"
   [70]
    1 string data = "Yes"
   [71]
    1 string data = "No"
   [72]
    1 string data = "Come back anytime!"
   [73]
    1 string data = "Heading out? Have a look at my equipment and food!"
   [74]
    1 string data = "So much to learn here..."
   [75]
    1 string data = "Thank you again for helping with Malkomud. I promise we will do better from now on. "
   [76]
    1 string data = "If you want to go to Brisk, you can use the big flying lift to the south of the village."
   [77]
    1 string data = "Good day, Solstice Warriors. Everything has been going well with Malkomud since you helped us."
   [78]
    1 string data = "SOLSTICE WARRIORS! There you are!"
   [79]
    1 string data = "??"
   [80]
    1 string data = "The Sleeper woke up and flew off! We have no idea where it is now, but it appears we are all doomed!"
   [81]
    1 string data = "Malkomud promised it wasn't one of his mischiefs, and that you two were involved. Is that true?"
   [82]
    1 string data = "Oh, yes, you have nothing to fear. Wentworth is friendly now."
   [83]
    1 string data = "Wentworth? "
   [84]
    1 string data = "The Sleeper has a name now."
   [85]
    1 string data = "Oh? Very well, if you say so."
   [86]
    1 string data = "Are you the Solstice Warriors? I really hope you can defeat Malkomud..."
   [87]
    1 string data = "Thank you so much for helping with Malkomud. We will definitely watch our tongues in the future..."
   [88]
    1 string data = "We're still not perfect when it comes to communicating with Malkomud, but at least everyone is trying."
   [89]
    1 string data = "I can't sleep since Malkomud took over the mines. I fear his minions might attack the town at any moment!"
   [90]
    1 string data = "Oh, thank you, I can finally get some sleep!"
   [91]
    1 string data = "When I heard The Sleeper was gone, I thought it was the end of the world, but nothing has happened since."
   [92]
    1 string data = "This whole Malkomud business is so annoying, I just want to get back to work!"
   [93]
    1 string data = "It's good to be back in business. Servicing the wind tunnels is demanding, but teal amber is very valuable."
   [94]
    1 string data = "It's great that The Sleeper woke peacefully! Time to find new purpose, I suppose."
   [95]
    1 string data = "If the tunnels keep getting clogged, the wind will stop playing the melody through the mountain. If The Sleeper wakes up, we are doomed!"
   [96]
    1 string data = "Hope you're enjoying your time in our little outpost. Make sure you sleep at the inn if you haven't, geothermal rooms are something else!"
   [97]
    1 string data = "Just before The Sleeper left, there was a mouth-watering smell like you wouldn't believe!"
   [98]
    1 string data = "Made me want to eat some bread, so I did that, but it didn't come remotely close to what I was hoping for."
   [99]
    1 string data = "Be careful in the mines, apparently someone spotted a monstrous salamander..."
   [100]
    1 string data = "So the salamander was Malkomud's pet? What do you mean it just wanted to play?"
   [101]
    1 string data = "I got to play with Rockie. She's so sweet!"
   [102]
    1 string data = "Since the elder went in, the elevator hasn't returned. I suppose one would have to just jump in..."
   [103]
    1 string data = "So glad to be done with this ordeal, I can't wait to craft teal amber baubles again."
   [104]
    1 string data = "Our elder has been in a panic since The Sleeper woke up. "
   [105]
    1 string data = "Thank you for talking to the elder, I was beginning to worry about him."
   [106]
    1 string data = "I can't let my kids go outside with everything going on, it's too dangerous."
   [107]
    1 string data = "Things are finally back to normal. I'm just glad my kids are safe."
   [108]
    1 string data = "My kids play with Malkomud now. We really judged him too quickly, I feel like we shouldn't frown upon magic so much anymore..."
   [109]
    1 string data = "Even with all the panic going on, my brother won't come out of his studio. All he does is paint all day long..."
   [110]
    1 string data = "My brother finally finished a painting, I can't believe it!!"
   [111]
    1 string data = "My brother is still looking for his muse."
   [112]
    1 string data = "This will be my best work ever!"
   [113]
    1 string data = "I will show the world that us Molekin can do more than teal amber carving, just wait!"
   [114]
    1 string data = "My best work so far, but I must keep improving."
   [115]
    1 string data = "What? There is a model in Brisk who wants her essence captured?"
   [116]
    1 string data = "That's exactly the kind of inspiration I was looking for! "
   [117]
    1 string data = "I'm leaving immediately!"
   [118]
    1 string data = "Zzzzzzzzz... must... activate... mill... zzzzzzzzz..."
   [119]
    1 string data = "Why is everyone angry at Malkomud? I don't get it..."
   [120]
    1 string data = "Malkomud took hide and seek a little too seriously if you ask me!"
   [121]
    1 string data = "When I saw The Sleeper fly off towards the volcano, I wasn't afraid, I just thought it was cool!"
   [122]
    1 string data = "Are you really Solstice Warriors? That's so cool!"
   [123]
    1 string data = "Is it true you thought Malkomud's pet was a monster? Haha!"
   [124]
    1 string data = "Mom lets us play with Malkomud now! Rockie is really nice, too!"
   [125]
    1 string data = "When I grow up, I want to work in the ground like my parents."
   [126]
    1 string data = "Look, I made a fort like Malkomud!"
   [127]
    1 string data = "Malkomud told me what happened with The Sleeper, so I'm not afraid like the others."
   [128]
    1 string data = "Everyone was running around just a moment ago. Grown-ups are weird."
   [129]
    1 string data = "This is the best fort we've built so far. I really like it!"
   [130]
    1 string data = "I wonder what Malkomud would think of the fort..."
   [131]
    1 string data = "Mom says we can't go out. But it's boring in here, there's nothing to do!"
   [132]
    1 string data = "This is my favorite spot where to play. I like it because the view is pretty."
   [133]
    1 string data = "Malkomud says that the amazing smell was from a kitchen he built in the volcano mountain for his friend to make a giant bread. Pretty cool, right?"
   [134]
    1 string data = "Hey, you're the Solstice Warriors who helped us!"
   [135]
    1 string data = "Now that I have my tools back, I can remove the rock that was blocking the road to the fishing lake."
   [136]
    1 string data = "Hold on, it won't take long!"
   [137]
    1 string data = "There, the path is now clear!"
   [138]
    1 string data = "I hope this is of some help to you. Thanks again!"
   [139]
    1 string data = "You know what would be nice? A place to relax in a hot pool of water without being surrounded by people who engage in stress. "
   [140]
    1 string data = "Mirth, you say? We absolutely must do something with those hot springs! I will go right now!"
   [141]
    1 string data = "You can now relax at the spa in Mirth!"
   [142]
    1 string data = "Who knows what benefits may come of relieving some stress?"
   [143]
    1 string data = "It's terrible what happened in Brisk. We're sending a team to help as soon as we finish preparing!"
   [144]
    1 string data = "Some tools used for mining."
   [145]
    1 string data = "An expertly crafted table."
   [146]
    1 string data = "Handmade pots."
   [147]
    1 string data = "Hot!"
   [148]
    1 string data = "This device looks like a pump of sorts."
   [149]
    1 string data = "If this sculpture represents something, it is probably something abstract..."
   [150]
    1 string data = "The view dives into the horizon."
