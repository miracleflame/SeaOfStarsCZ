      "Welcome to the Elder Mist Trials.",
      "To pass this final test, you must bring three big relics together by completing their associated challenges.",
      "The monsters that will try to stop you are immune to physical attacks, and <color=magic>the use of offensive spells is prohibited</color>.",
      "What? How then?",
      "Hoo! That is why you must use magic without using magic!",
      "Live Mana can <color=magic>boost</color> your battle actions with a portion of your magic attack. Embrace this power, and your training will be complete.",
      "Whoa, I HAVE to try that...",
      "The trials await. Should you wish to return for a while, simply close your eyes and concentrate next to where you just appeared.",
      "Godspeed!",
      "...",
      "That attack did nothing!",
      "A spell would probably do it, but we can't use them here...",
      "Guess that's the part where “using magic without using magic” comes in.",
      "But how?",
      "...",
      "Hey, some <color=magic>little orbs</color> appeared when I attacked.",
      "Maybe that's “Live Mana”?",
      "Could be, I feel a kind of pull towards them.",
      "Yeah I feel it too. Let me try something.",
      "Whoa!!!",
      "It worked! How does it feel?",
      "Like power! So if I attack it should do magic damage now.",
      "That was amazing! I want to try it next!",
      "<color=magic>Boosting</color> has been unlocked!",
      "Regular attacks will now generate Live Mana. Hold <button=\"Combat_Boost\"> and press <button=Interact\"> to absorb a charge and <color=magic>boost</color>!",
      "Up to three boosting charges can be stacked, each adding a portion of your character's Magic Attack stat to their next action to increase its power.",
      "In the case of regular attacks, the character's innate magic damage type (if they have one) is also added on top of their weapon's damage type.",
      "Whether you are dealing with an intricate lock pattern, need to make your next healing spell really count, or just want to deal more damage, remember to boost!",
      "Hoo hoo hoo...",
      "The young adventurers have finished the preparations.",
      "Huh?",
      "I see you understand the power of Live Mana.",
      "But can you master it? We shall see!",
      "The <color=magic>use of spells is now allowed</color> again.",
      "Face me, Children of the Solstice!",
      "How formidable!",
      "Hoo! A bright future awaits you indeed.",
      "[MAINCHAR] and [OFFCHAR], I name you <color=good>Solstice Warriors</color>!",
      "I knew it! You're the BEST!",
      "Ha! There it is!",
      "We did it!",
      "I have consulted the Mists of Time during your trials.",
      "When you are ready to leave this place, find me back at the Sacred Pond and I will tell you of your respective prophecies.",
      "Then you will be sent out into the world! Hoo!",
      "Don't take too long now.",
      "To get this artifact piece, you will need to answer three questions correctly. Let's see how well you learned.",
      "Of these two actions, which one regenerates MP.",
      "Attacking",
      "Casting a spell",
      "Wrong! The correct answer was: Attacking.",
      "What is the name of the school you went to?",
      "Zenith Academy",
      "Solstice Elementary",
      "Wrong! The correct answer was: Zenith Academy.",
      "One very important Solstice Warrior duty is to destroy Dwellers, who become vulnerable during which natural phenomenon?",

      "Eclipse",
      "Solstice",
      "Wrong! The correct answer was: Eclipse.",
      "This is our last chance to prepare. Do you feel ready?",
      "Yes!",
      "Wait",
      "Return to Mountain Trail?",
      "Yes",
      "No",
      "Hoo hoo hoo!",
      "Strong you are indeed!",
