   [51]
    1 string data = "Narcis King is so smart, he does things just long enough to be able to project a wide range of abilities. Doesn't waste a single minute beyond that."
   [52]
    1 string data = "Hanging out here, I learned there's no value left in doing anything once you've got a good picture to show off. To stay on top of everyone else, it's better to diversify!"

   [54]

   [56]
    1 string data = "It's weird in here. I feel like I have to justify why I like what I like, as if my value had to be calculated according to the Narcis King's criteria."
   [57]
    1 string data = "I heard a guard saying "reflection opens the way" earlier. What do you think he meant?"
   [58]

   [60]
    1 string data = "The floors are immaculate! But I must say, this would look even better if the gem's reflection were aligned with the ornate doorframe."
