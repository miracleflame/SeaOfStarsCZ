      "THE ELDER HASN'T RETURNED!",
      "<color=bad>MALKOMUD</color> WILL KILL US ALL!",
      "RUN!!!",
      "Who are you? Have you come to save us?",
      "Well...",
      "Of course, they're Solstice Warriors!",
      "Garl!",
      "It's true, no? We should help if we can!",
      "What's the matter?",
      "It's Malkomud, the earth elemental wizard...",
      "We're just a peaceful little outpost, taking care of the mine's wind tunnels.",
      "It's our job it is, to keep them unobstructed, so that the wind can play the melody for <color=bad>The Sleeper</color>.",
      "!!",
      "But now Malkomud has taken over the mines, so we can't go in anymore.",
      "And if The Sleeper wakes, it will be THE END OF THE WORLD!",
      "What's more, he clogged the tunnel powering the great elevator's windmill, so we can't even go to <color=location>Brisk</color> to ask for help...",
      "If this continues, Malkomud's minions will start pouring out of the mines, and...",
      "And...",
      "It's okay, we're here to help. What happened next?",
      "The... the elder went in to try and stop him but, it's been so long...",
      "Where's the entrance?",
      "Just up there, at the top of the outpost, but Malkomud is very powerful...",
      "Don't worry, we'll find your elder.",
      "One evil wizard, going down!",
      "Oh, what luck! Thank you!",
      "EVERYONE, STOP PANICKING!",
      "SOLSTICE WARRIORS ARE HERE TO SOLVE EVERYTHING!",
      "THE ELDER WILL RETURN!",
      "MALKOMUD WON'T KILL US ALL!",
      "YAY!",
      "...",
      "I'll let you get on with it then. There's still lots for me to learn here!",
      "The Solstice Warriors have returned!",
      "Has the threat been contained?",
      "Malkomud agreed to stop clogging the wind tunnels.",
      "We are safe!",
      "Hurray!",
      "You should have mentioned your role in this.",
      "I...",
      "Apologies, brave monk. We struggle indeed to give proper bearings to one of his... talent.",
      "Well, you all better be more respectful in the future. ",
      "We might not be here to save you if this happens again.",
      "...",
      "Understood. You have our word and our thanks.",
      "Is there anything we can do to repay you?",
      "We're looking for a crew of adventurers who might help us sail to another island.",
      "Oh! In that case you will want to visit the Port Town of Brisk!",
      "Feel free to use the big lift to the south. You're the ones who fixed it after all.",
      "A port town, surely we can find a ship there!",
      "It's got all sorts of people. You're bound to find what you're looking for.",
      "Oh I can't wait, there might even be a tavern!",
      "Let's try that lift.",
      "Oh, the irony...",
      "What's the matter?",
      "I need my tools to fix this busted door, but they're in the back room and I can't get through!",
      "The lever on the other side seems to work fine though. If only there was another way to enter...",
      "I'll try to find another entrance.",
      "Why, thank you!",
      "Hey, good job kid!",
      "Oh, and you didn't even open my chests? Very admirable! ",
      "But you were a great help. Please help yourself to their contents.",
      "Were my chests okay?",
      "...",
      "Haha, just kidding! It's the least I could offer as payment.",
      "Thanks for the help!",
      "The watermill stopped functioning after Malkomud clogged the wind tunnels. There's no more water in the well!",
      "I really want to take a bath! Will you go in the mines to help?",
      "I really want to take a bath!",
      "The pump is in there, probably just needs to be restarted...",
      "Would you mind going?",
      "I'll see what I can do.",
      "Hey, you did it!",
      "Thanks, I really needed that. Here, for your troubles.",
      "Welcome to the Sleepy Mason! Would you like to rest in our geothermal room?",
      "YES",
      "NO",
      "Come back anytime!",
      "Heading out? Have a look at my equipment and food!",
      "So much to learn here...",
      "Thank you again for helping with Malkomud. I promise we will do better from now on. ",
      "If you want to go to Brisk, you can use the big flying lift to the south of the village.",
      "Good day, Solstice Warriors. Everything has been going well with Malkomud since you helped us.",
      "SOLSTICE WARRIORS! There you are!",
      "??",
      "The Sleeper woke up and flew off! We have no idea where it is now, but it appears we are all doomed!",
      "Malkomud promised it wasn't one of his mischiefs, and that you two were involved. Is that true?",
      "Oh, yes, you have nothing to fear. Wentworth is friendly now.",
      "Wentworth? ",
      "The Sleeper has a name now.",
      "Oh? Very well, if you say so.",
      "...",
      "Are you the Solstice Warriors? I really hope you can defeat Malkomud...",
      "Thank you so much for helping with Malkomud. We will definitely watch our tongues in the future...",
      "We're still not perfect when it comes to communicating with Malkomud, but at least everyone is trying.",
      "I can't sleep since Malkomud took over the mines. I fear his minions might attack the town at any moment!",
      "Oh thank you, I can finally get some sleep!",
      "When I heard The Sleeper was gone I thought it was the end of the world, but nothing has happened since.",
      "This whole Malkomud business is so annoying, I just want to get back to work!",
      "It's good to be back in business. Servicing the wind tunnels is demanding, but teal amber is very valuable.",
      "It's great that The Sleeper woke peacefully! Time to find new purpose, I suppose.",
      "If the tunnels keep getting clogged the wind will stop playing the melody through the mountain. If The Sleeper wakes up we are doomed!",
      "Hope you're enjoying your time in our little outpost. Make sure you sleep at the inn if you haven't--geothermal rooms are something else!",
      "Just before The Sleeper left, there was a mouth-watering smell like you wouldn't believe!",
      "Made me want to eat some bread so I did that, but it didn't come remotely close to what I was hoping for.",
      "Be careful in the mines, apparently someone spotted a monstrous salamander...",
      "So the salamander was Malkomud's pet? What do you mean it just wanted to play?",
      "I got to play with Rockie. She's so sweet!",
      "Since the elder went in, the elevator hasn't returned. I suppose one would have to just jump in...",
      "So glad to be done with this ordeal, I can't wait to craft teal amber baubles again.",
      "Our Elder has been in a panic since The Sleeper woke up. ",
      "Thank you for talking to the Elder, I was beginning to worry about him.",
      "I can't let my kids go outside with everything going on, it's too dangerous.",
      "Things are finally back to normal. I'm just glad my kids are safe.",
      "My kids play with Malkomud now. We really judged him too quickly, I feel like we shouldn't frown upon magic so much anymore...",
      "Even with all the panic going on, my brother won't come out of his studio. All he does is paint all day long...",
      "My brother finally finished a painting, I can't believe it!!",
      "My brother is still looking for his muse.",
      "This will be my best work ever!",
      "I will show the world that us Molekins can do more than teal amber carving, just wait!",
      "My best work so far, but I must keep improving.",
      "What? There is a model in Brisk who wants her essence captured?",
      "That's exactly the kind of inspiration I was looking for! ",
      "I'm leaving immediately!",
      "Zzzzzzzzz... must... activate... mill... zzzzzzzzz...",
      "Why is everyone angry at Malkomud? I don't get it...",
      "Malkomud took hide and seek a little too seriously if you ask me!",
      "When I saw The Sleeper fly off towards the volcano I wasn't afraid, I just thought it was cool!",
      "Are you really Solstice Warriors? That's so cool!",
      "Is it true you thought Malkomud's pet was a monster? Haha!",
      "Mom lets us play with Malkomud now! Rockie is really nice, too!",
      "When I grow up, I want to work in the ground like my parents.",
      "Look, I made a fort like Malkomud!",
      "Malkomud told me what happened with The Sleeper, so I'm not afraid like the others.",
      "Everyone was running around just a moment ago. Grown ups are weird.",
      "This is the best fort we've built so far. I really like it!",
      "I wonder what Malkomud would think of the fort...",
      "Mom says we can't go out. But it's boring in here, there's nothing to do!",
      "This is my favorite spot where to play. I like it because the view is pretty.",
      "Malkomud says that the amazing smell was from a kitchen he built in the volcano mountain for his friend to make a giant bread. Pretty cool, right?",
      "Hey, you're the Solstice Warriors who helped us!",
      "Now that I have my tools back, I can remove the rock that was blocking the road to the fishing lake.",
      "Hold on, it won't take long!",
      "There, the path is now clear!",
      "I hope this is of some help to you. Thanks again!",
      "You know what would be nice? A place to relax in hot pool of water without being surrounded by people who engage in stress. ",
      "Mirth, you say? We absolutely must do something with those hot springs! I will go right now!",
      "You can now relax at the Spa in Mirth!",
      "Who knows what benefits may come of relieving some stress?",
      "It's terrible what happened in Brisk. We're sending a team to help as soon as we finish preparing!",
      "Some tools used for mining.",
      "An expertly crafted table.",
      "Handmade pots.",
      "Hot!",
      "This device looks like a pump of sorts.",
      "If this sculpture represents something, it is probably something abstract...",
      "The view dives into the horizon."
