      "We made it! Time to stop for a snack.",
      "What? I'm not hungry.",
      "Yeah, we just left a few minutes ago.",
      "Look it's not a real adventure if you don't eat a snack on the road.",
      "Plus, I made something special for the occasion.",
      "Here!",
      "Wow, that's really good!",
      "Yeah no kidding!",
      "Glad you like it.",
      "It's the jam. I used a bit of sap from the <color=magic>Celestial Willow</color>.",
      "You could get in trouble for that.",
      "Only if you tell.",
      "Hahaha!",
      "Alright, how do I do this?",
      "Maybe like Erlina showed me?",
      "Try opening your palm and concentrating.",
      "You got this Valere!",
      "I KNEW IT!!!",
      "IT WORKED!?",
      "...",
      "I did it...",
      "I FINALLY DID IT!!!",
      "So... what now?",
      "The Headmaster must have heard the bell ring.",
      "Do we just wait for him to show up?",
      "Might as well enter, it can be our first adventure!",
      "Yeah, and then the Headmaster will know we're NOT afraid!",
      "This is exciting, let's go!",
      "Come on [MAINCHAR], I want to see the cavern!",
      "There's <color=bad>monsters</color> over there, let's hide!",
      "I thought Evermist Island was safe.",
      "Guess that's only true for Mooncradle...",
      "We should go back, they look dangerous.",
      "Yeah good call.",
      "Watch out, there's another one!",
      "This is bad! We're surrounded!",
      "Maybe try to use your powers?",
      "We're not ready for this...",
      "I... I don't know, just try!",
      "Okay, let me focus.",
      "Watch out, it's preparing something!",
      "...",
      "Come on, come on!",
      "[MAINCHAR], watch out!",
      "AAAAAHHHHHGGGG!",
      "NO!!!",
      "My eye!!",
      "GAAAAAARL!",
      "It really hurts...",
      "I... I can't see...",
      "...",
      "There's no escape...",
      "It's about to attack again!",
      "So it was you...",
      "As resourceful as you are reckless, I see.",
      "Headmaster! Garl needs help!",
      "It... feels better...",
      "Like anyone born in Mooncradle a regular kid, what Garl needs is to not concern himself with the affairs of the Solstice Warriors!",
      "I'm really sorry, Headmaster. It was all my idea...",
      "Hey!",
      "...",
      "Be thankful that the only cost of this lesson was an eye, young lad.",
      "As for the two of you, if you are so eager to receive training I shall oblige.",
      "Follow me.",
      "And you always wanted to be like Moyara.",
      "Over twenty Solstice Warriors died that day and what, we just move on?",
      "I was dumb. I don't want to be a hero anymore.",
      "I never wanted to be one...",
      "And no matter what I do Moraine always says I'm not fast enough. I just feel awful.",
      "I know, Brugaves...",
      "If there's a way out, I'll find it for us.",
      "Well, I'm cold...",
      "And I'm hungry.",
      "We're helpless...",
      "Alright let's go back.",
      "Back to learning magic. Yay.",
      "Sure feels easier now.",
      "This time we make it through.",
      "The device is broken, we can't activate the bridge.",
      "There seems to be a detour through there, to the left.",
      "Worth a shot.",
      "Valere?",
      "Sounds big. Get Ready!",
      "OUR FIRST BIG ONE!",
      "Haha! We did it!",
      "Looks like there's a way out, over there.",
      "The mountain shouldn't be much further now.",
      "[MAINCHAR], there's a <color=magic>campfire</color> spot here. We should rest a little to heal up while we can.",
      "It's locked.",
      "Maybe the key is in the chest just up there?",
      "It's out of reach for now. Let's look around.",
      "Hey this glowing scroll looks powerful, we should check it out.",
      "Use the scroll from your inventory to learn the new combo."
