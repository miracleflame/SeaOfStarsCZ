      "GET OFF RIGHT NOW!!!",
      "...",
      "What happened? I saw someone, and then...",
      "Welcome to the Sea ov Nightmare!",
      "Nice going binding yer souls to an ancient pirate curse like that.",
      "Hello we... plan on claiming the ship for ourselves.",
      "Hahaha! Now THAT'S a good one!",
      "And how do y'all plan on doing that?",
      "...",
      "These two are Solstice Warriors.",
      "Pardon?",
      "They can use Solstice Magic. No creature is immune to it.",
      "Solstice Magic, huh? How can such a coincidence...",
      "Yer 'nother hallucination, ain't ye?",
      "BRACE!!",
      "Alright, <color=bad>Stormcaller</color> has sensed yer presence. I s'pose this makes ya real.",
      "So you're the one known as “The Navigator?”",
      "<color=good>Hortence</color> be the name. Use it.",
      "Can't imagine how y'all ended up here, but it's a relief someone can finally fight those things.",
      "You mean the ghost pirates? Aren't they...",
      "My former crewmates? Aye, going along with mutiny'll do ya in like lil' else.",
      "Well, I s'pose instigating mutiny is worse. Sometimes I wish I was also made an undead of the brainless sort...",
      "So, your former captain, this Stormcaller-- how can we stop him?",
      "If the last couple centuries have taught me anything, it's that we can't. See, the curse only has two possible outcomes.",
      "Either Stormcaller gives up, or I let The Vespertine sink, and by the looks of it neither is happening anytime soon.",
      "What if we fought him?",
      "??",
      "Look alive, Stormcaller be the most formidable wind mage the world has ever known!",
      "We can hold our own in battle.",
      "Oh? Reckon ya can beat a grudge so strong it magicked a parallel nightmare realm in which to torture a crew for all eternity?",
      "...",
      "Look, if y'all are foolish enough to wag yer swords at him I won't stop ya, but first his wind barrier needs weakening.",
      "Where do we begin?",
      "There're three lightning rods sending power back to the maelstrom where he channels this never-ending storm.",
      "Y'all want to confront him, that's the first step.",
      "Where are the rods?",
      "Even if I knew, ain't no way to tell which way is up in this nightmare.",
      "Okay, how 'bout this for a first test?",
      "My map should be below decks, in the kitchen past the crew quarters.",
      "If y'all can fetch it and return alive, I'll entertain this plan o' yers.",
      "One map, coming up!",
      "That's the map. Let's return to Hortence.",
      "Hey, y'all're starting to give me hope!",
      "So how can we find the rods?",
      "The magic map connects to the sea. Should allow ye to get an idea ov the place.",
      "Okay, we got this!",
      "Why don't ye take the wheel? I could certainly use a break.",
      "Looks like a logbook.",
      "These cannons haven't been fired in a while.",
      "Whoever crafted this knew what they were doing.",
      "The deed is done.",
      "What now?",
      "WE BRACE!!!",
      "Free at last...",
      "It's finally over, Hortence!",
      "Hahaha! Now THAT feels good!",
      "Hey, I know you haven't had a break in forever, but... there's these people we still need to help.",
      "Aye! Reckon I owe ye one. Friends o' yers are friends o' mine.",
      "Take me to 'em.",
      "My map should be below decks, in the kitchen past the crew quarters.",
      "Did ye find the map?"
