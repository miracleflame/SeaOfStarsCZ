      "Of all the recorded hexes and acts of bewitchment, few are as dreadful as the curse of <color=bad>The Vespertine</color>.",
      "This story takes us back centuries, to a time when a certain band of pirates ruled the seas.",
      "<color=bad>Stormcaller</color> was the name of their captain. He was the most powerful wind mage the world had ever known.",
      "And their navigator, <color=good>Hortence</color>, remains to this day the shrewdest mariner on record.",
      "Combining Hortence's skill and Stormcaller's magic, some say their ship was faster than light itself.",
      "The crew went on many adventures and accumulated countless riches until, one day, the inevitable happened.",
      "Hortence, whose first love was music, announced that she wanted to quit the pirate life and devote herself to her art full time.",
      "Ever a firm believer that the real treasure is the treasure one finds along the way, Stormcaller took her resignation... harshly.",
      "Utterly insulted, he stopped conjuring wind for the sails and locked the ship right in the middle of the ocean.",
      "“And we shall remain here,” he said, “'til our NAVIGATOR gets that silly idea out o' her head!”",
      "But Hortence had already made her final decision.",
      "Days went by, both of them sulking while their crew begged that they reach some resolution.",
      "First they ran out of patience, then out of food, and eventually out of drinkable water.",
      "Then one day after sunset, the pirates driven mad by hunger and thirst mutinied and made their captain walk the plank.",
      "And as he sank into the abyss, Stormcaller cursed his crew and conjured an eternal prison.",
      "In the <color=bad>Sea of Nightmare</color>, he would channel a deadly storm for them to endure forevermore.",
      "Over centuries, the crew members lost their minds to the ghastly place, until only Hortence remained.",
      "To this day, the battle goes on in the Sea of Nightmare, Stormcaller's hatred pitted against the navigator's sheer will.",
      "Some say Stormcaller's fury will one day sink the ship, while others believe he will eventually bow to the indomitable Hortence.",
      "Legend has it she gets a short break once a day, for but a few seconds, at the precise time the curse was first conjured.",
      "Countless sailors and fishermen have since reported sightings of the legendary ghost pirate ship that appears at dusk.",
      "They call it <color=bad>The Vespertine</color>.",
      "While some have half a mind to climb aboard in search of treasure, most avoid sailing at dusk for fear of being sucked into the Sea of Nightmare.",
      "The end.",
      "What few people know today is that Kunus'nuku had already been banished by the time the Great Summoning happened.",
      "The channeling had begun months prior, back when the Lizardfolk still had the upper hand.",
      "It was toward the end of the decades-long battle, after it became clear that the Molekin mages would be the victors.",
      "On this night of nights, the air carried early cries of victory across the archipelago.",
      "Suddenly, the very sky tore open, and a giant Sky Serpent emerged to wreak havoc.",
      "To this day, historians argue about the origins of the Sky Serpent.",
      "Some say it is a monster of pure evil, stolen from another plane of existence and forced to remain here.",
      "Others believe it came from above the clouds--a once friendly creature that had its mind corrupted by dark magic.",
      "But regardless of its origins, the Sky Serpent was set to change the world forever.",
      "Back in the time of the Ovates, the ritual of the elements could have been performed to control the Sky Serpent's mind.",
      "But alas, the Ovates were long gone.",
      "Earth magic being their only strength at hand, the Molekin elementalists devised a plan to contain the threat.",
      "By carving intricate wind tunnels straight into X'tol's Mountain, they turned it into a giant musical instrument.",
      "Blowing through the mountain, the wind started playing a melody so pure, it forced the Sky Serpent into slumber.",
      "The magic was strong, and it was believed that the world would remain safe for generations.",
      "Or rather, for as long as the mountain played the melody true.",
      "For the greater good, the Molekin gave up on their study of magic, and established an outpost atop the mountain.",
      "Over generations, they became expert miners, living by a pledge to keep the wind tunnels operational.",
      "The brave Molekin have toiled around the clock ever since, protecting the world one pickaxe strike at a time.",
      "Despite centuries of stability, stories say that the magic enchantment on the wind tunnels will eventually fade away.",
      "One can only hope that the Ovates will return before then...",
      "The end.",
      "There once was a botanist who attempted to trick Death by growing a rose so pretty she couldn't bear to reap it.",
      "Smitten, Death spiraled into confusion as she appreciated the beauty of life for the very first time.",
      "Whether her next action was fueled by jealous rage or opportunistic guile, no one really knows.",
      "Using wicked magic, she turned the flower into something even more beautiful, but very cursed indeed.",
      "The Vampire Rose.",
      "A thing of beckoning beauty, compelling all who lay eyes upon it to willingly take part in their own corruption.",
      "Rumors of the magical rose reached all corners of the world, carrying a simple promise.",
      "A promise few could resist: eternal life, provided they could take it.",
      "Despite the elation offered by the initial touch, the price became apparent all too quickly.",
      "For every second spent holding the Vampire Rose, a year would be added to one's lifespan.",
      "But for every borrowed year, a thorn would grow on one of their bones.",
      "Stories say that, of all the people to touch the Vampire Rose, most realized their mistake instantly.",
      "Having extended their lives by but a single year, they'd release their grip and live on, only with a very painful reminder felt in their every move.",
      "But there were others unable to stop themselves, and became what few would describe as human, or even alive.",
      "Though it is unclear whether the Vampire Rose yet exists, everyone agrees on one thing.",
      "It appears that, in the end, Death always gets the last laugh in the faces of those foolish enough to try and cheat her.",
      "The end.",
      "It is said that whenever twins are born on a solstice, fate itself flips a coin.",
      "Their innate magic would either be incredibly heightened, or corrupted into something that ought to be contained for the greater good.",
      "For generations, many Solstice Warrior twins have accomplished great deeds, but despite their immense potential, could never ascend into Guardian Gods.",
      "For ascension requires one of the winter and one of the summer... but kindred souls are not meant to part for eternity.",
      "On a particularly warm summer solstice, fate's coin landed on its edge, and triplets were born.",
      "As the Great Eagle's instincts indicated, it soon became apparent that morality had split itself in three, as if to see their innate magic expressed in distinct flavors.",
      "Because their actions would inevitably drive them far away from one another, they were given annoyingly similar names: Moyara, Yomara, and Romaya.",
      "Moyara was flown to Mooncradle, where she became a formidable Solstice Warrior, and Zenith Academy's Headmistress.",
      "Ever the stalwart protector, Moyara gave her life while leading the charge against the Dweller of Strife.",
      "Yomara was the neutral one, better known as The Crone of Songshroom Marsh.",
      "Living a secluded life, she is an observer of the distant future, offering cryptic insights on key events and looming threats that may or may not transpire.",
      "By age five, she had correctly predicted that The Fleshmancer would leave if the Dweller of Strife were defeated--at the cost Moyara's life.",
      "Despite her immense power, she remains impartial in all conflicts.",
      "Meanwhile, Romaya devoted her every waking moment to studying what could be understood of The Fleshmancer's ways, and developed forbidden arts of her own.",
      "Through her understanding of blood magic, she became the first necromancer, and devised a way to trap souls within objects.",
      "One notable invention of hers is candles that never burn out, noticeable by Romaya's signature green fire.",
      "Through their extreme commitment to differing paths, the Three Sisters have prompted countless musings on the choices one makes in life.",
      "To live bravely and selflessly like Moyara, and embrace an early death while fighting for a worthy cause.",
      "Or to live a quiet and peaceful, albeit solitary life, like Yomara... Foregoing ambition for the sake of safety, but never discovering one's true self.",
      "Or perhaps to indulge oneself like Romaya, with utter confidence in her ability to overcome any retribution she might face as a result of her corruption.",
      "Could the Three Sisters truly be a trick of fate, or the spiteful game of Gods unknown?",
      "Or is it simply that, in our search for meaning, we sometimes mistake pure happenstance for prophecy?",
      "It is probably for the best that we shall never know.",
      "The end.",
      "Countless millennia ago, two powerful alchemists named Resh'an and Aephorul set out to create the elixir of life, and succeeded.",
      "As all things in alchemy come at a price, the gift of immortality caused their bodies to decay, leading them to conceal their hideousness under colorful robes.",
      "Revelling at first in the bright side of their immortal coil, they spent centuries nurturing the world and creating wonders to inspire its mortals.",
      "Over time, however, Aephorul grew increasingly jealous of the ephemerality he would never taste again.",
      "Thus began his wicked journey into the forbidden schools of alchemy.",
      "A journey which would see every last bit of good in his heart dissipate, as he experimented with soul, bone, flesh, and blood alike.",
      "As fate would have it, Aephorul fully embraced evil and emerged as The Fleshmancer, a vengeful immortal plaguing the world with his monstrous creations.",
      "Resh'an tried intervening as best he could, but all that ensued was unspeakable chaos and collateral damage as the two former friends fought with godlike powers.",
      "After much struggle, Resh'an discovered the flesh minions' only weaknesses to be Solar and Lunar magic--a power bestowed upon those born during a solstice.",
      "He began training these children to become Solstice Warriors, singularly tasked with culling the numbers of The Fleshmancer's creations.",
      "But Aephorul's knowledge was also growing. Eventually, he became capable of creating oddities of unlimited potential, known as Dwellers.",
      "They would be impervious to all forms of magic--except during a total eclipse, when Solstice Warriors would have a very short window to attempt taking them down.",
      "And Dwellers, it turned out, were creatures in development feeding on local life.",
      "Left to their own devices for too long, they would evolve into World Eaters, spelling doom for all.",
      "Armed with knowledge and power, Solstice Warriors would patrol the world, tracking Dwellers to determine which should be taken down during the next eclipse.",
      "If they remained vigilant, there would never be a World Eater, but Resh'an knew such a stalemate would only cause Aephorul to devise something even worse.",
      "In a desperate attempt to get ahead, Resh'an boldly performed transmutation alchemy on the very space-time continuum itself.",
      "After successfully splitting reality into countless timelines and parallel worlds, he shelved his alchemy vial and took up the mantle of Archivist.",
      "On an endless journey across all realities, he would catalog every possible outcome in search of a resolution to the throes of The Fleshmancer.",
      "Meanwhile, Aephorul rejoiced at the infinite number of opportunities for destruction that had just opened up to him.",
      "To find some measure of peace amidst their immortal conflict, the two alchemists made a pact to let the fate of each timeline play out on its own.",
      "And so the game of cat and mouse began, played by Dwellers and Solstice Warriors on one level, and by Resh'an and Aephorul on another.",
      "Across a myriad of timelines and over innumerous centuries, some worlds would never be visited by Aephorul, while others would be cursed by his mark.",
      "Once marked, it was only a matter of time until a world met its finality, often following centuries of struggle.",
      "Each would either be destroyed by a World Eater, or permanently saved by the ascension of a pair of Solstice Warriors into Guardian Gods.",
      "As to when Resh'an plans on recomposing the timelines, or whether he even knows how, remains to be seen.",
      "The end.",
      "It was as compelling as invitations could get.",
      "All of the best artisans the world over received it: a personalized letter signed by the mysterious Great Eagle.",
      "Enclosed were directions, along with the promise of a worthwhile endeavor and a touch of magic.",
      "They gathered en masse on the barren island to the southwest, hoping to meet the mysterious “Great Eagle” who had signed their invitations.",
      "But all they found when they arrived were three vials, two of which were sealed.",
      "When they opened the first vial, it became clear to all that there was even more to the Great Eagle than what the stories had shared.",
      "As the cork was removed, a solar eclipse occurred and magical light flew in from above the sky, reshaping the peninsula into a crescent.",
      "At the end of its dance, the light coalesced on the cliffside and gave birth to a tree so beautiful it appeared to belong in a dream.",
      "The Celestial Willow rose up while the grass turned to its signature purple hue.",
      "As if the magic had spoken directly to their minds, the builders knew exactly what they had to do.",
      "They would build the town of Mooncradle, and hold a festival by the Celestial Willow twice a year, in expectation of the Great Eagle's visit.",
      "Unless they happened to be born in Mooncradle, Children of the Solstice would never know their real parents.",
      "So that no one would feel different or rejected, Mooncradle was built around one core tenet: community.",
      "They built a common dormitory for everyone, along with a single shared dining hall.",
      "Zenith Academy was also clearly visible in all of their minds. They built it, but had no idea how to give it its final touch.",
      "That was when the second vial uncorked itself.",
      "Glowing runes flew out and embedded themselves into Zenith Academy's foundation, enchanting it with levitation magic. The School in the Sky was born.",
      "As if to celebrate the builders' efforts, the third seal was undone, and out of the tiny vial flowed a seemingly endless stream of mist.",
      "It permeated Evermist Island, giving it its name. In the end, a peculiar voice spoke to their minds.",
      "The voice provided guidelines for the education of Solstice Warriors, and stressed the importance of seeking out \"The Elder Mist\" once their training was complete.",
      "As the voice grew faint, the three vials disappeared.",
      "Since that day, the people of Mooncradle have held the festival to welcome Children of the Solstice, taking it upon themselves to nurture them until they come of age.",
      "Solstice Warriors would come and go, protecting the world while attempting to fulfill the prophecies bestowed upon them by The Elder Mist.",
      "As the battle continues between Dwellers and Solstice Warriors, Mooncradle represents the hope that someday, Guardian Gods may rise and bring about lasting peace.",
      "The end.",
      "When Aephorul first arrived in our realm, he brought with him a group of kid geniuses.",
      "If stories are to be believed, Caël and his friends had struck a deal with him to free their people.",
      "In The Fleshmancer's new base of operations, they would toil away, creating machines for obscure uses in realms unknown.",
      "But such a base had yet to be built, so as always, Aephorul set out to locate the best collaborator there was to be found.",
      "He needed someone morally neutral--for it was execution he desired, not competition.",
      "With this new lair, he would prove himself superior to Resh'an by building a castle that would control time within itself.",
      "The Watchmaker was the perfect fit. She was only interested in her craft, and otherwise had no interest in Aephorul's machinations.",
      "All she asked for in return was a workshop of her own, where she could be left to her devices.",
      "The deal was struck, and together they designed the Clockwork Castle.",
      "The Watchmaker began drafting schematics for the kids to start production on, while she'd handle the more intricate parts herself.",
      "Meanwhile, Aephorul enchanted countless cogs and bricks, giving them an aura of magic that none could understand.",
      "Construction was almost complete when Caël and his crew made their move.",
      "One night, they flipped exactly the right cogs so that once the castle's perpetual movement was activated, its core function would backfire.",
      "They had no goal in mind other than foiling The Fleshmancer's plans, and in that respect, they'd succeeded resoundingly.",
      "What came of the sabotage was that time now came to a halt within the Clockwork Castle, or rather, within its inhabitants.",
      "And they had played their trick so well, that Aephorul didn't even know they'd done it on purpose.",
      "There would be no impressing Resh'an this time, but he could definitely see some upsides to a workshop that operated forever.",
      "As a final touch, he ensured that any mortal leaving the castle would see themselves age instantly by the amount of time they'd spent inside.",
      "Upon completion, Aephorul locked everyone inside for a century, ensuring that The Watchmaker and the children could never leave, lest they die instantly of old age.",
      "The Watchmaker thought nothing of it, and relished the opportunity to focus on her craft for an eternity.",
      "Yet in this time prison, Caël and his friends would have to work day and night.",
      "Proud of having done the right thing, it seems they are at peace with their situation. Perhaps getting to be kids forever helps, in a way.",
      "From day one they would always deliver, while adding just the right amount of breakage to give The Fleshmancer countless headaches without raising suspicion.",
      "One can only feel gratitude when contemplating the suffering that's been delayed, or even prevented, thanks to their cunning game of wasting Aephorul's time.",
      "The end.",
      "It was like a dream.",
      "No one believed it at first, that their seemingly eternal journey could finally be over.",
      "Why them? And with the current Oracle of Tides being so young, who could confirm the long-awaited discovery?",
      "But in their heart of hearts, they knew: before them, appearing even more vividly than in their visions, stood the Tower of Antsudlo.",
      "And so it was that The Nomads of the Sea, who had traversed abyssal plains since time immemorial, would settle at long last.",
      "Having reached their promised land, they started building next to the tower.",
      "In Docarri Village, generations would come and go, each following the guidance of their respective Oracle of Tides.",
      "Since that day, they have been the guardians of Antsudlo, waiting for those destined to open its gate.",
      "In this new era, memories of their nomadic days live on in classic tales, retelling the deeds of great explorers and formidable warriors.",
      "The most popular by far is the Battle of Fate's Guyot--a story with so many versions, it may very well be just a myth.",
      "To the best of their abilities, historians have pieced together hints from various retellings of the battle, some even dedicating their lives to the subject.",
      "It is generally accepted as fact that the Docarri almost went extinct while crossing the territory of a gigantic sea slug.",
      "What happened next is a matter of much debate, depending on the interpretation of key passages and the credibility of certain sources.",
      "Some claim that the Battle of Fate's Guyot never happened, dismissing it as a fabrication meant to scare off would-be pillagers of ancient Docarri treasure.",
      "This theory is mostly seen as a stretch, however, given that such looters' inability to breathe underwater would already be deterrent enough.",
      "Some historians say that the giant sea slug was defeated when the Docarri made their last stand on a flat-topped seamount, giving the story its title.",
      "For others, the scriptures about sunken ruins are simply too consistent to be ignored.",
      "According to this version of events, the nomads sealed the monster away when they realized they couldn't defeat it.",
      "The key was then split into three equal parts, each waiting somewhere in the deep blue for future heroes brave enough to rid the world of this threat.",
      "The end.",
      "Ewilda was a fair leader who cared not for titles.",
      "Stories say that she spent equal time at Aventry Manor as she did in town with her people.",
      "Under her reign, Lucent knew prosperity, and upheld its title as Bastion of Light like never before.",
      "By her side was Duke Aventry, a proud noble and fierce defender of his land and people.",
      "Ever stalwart, it is said that the flame of his dedication to Lucent burned only cooler than that of his fiery love for Ewilda.",
      "Despite the looming threat of the Clockwork Castle, they managed to keep their people safe, happy, and hopeful.",
      "One night, during a long journey abroad like so many others, Duke Aventry was awoken by an emissary carrying urgent orders.",
      "Ewilda demanded that he return to Lucent at once, offering no explanation beyond hinting at some dire threat.",
      "When the Duke arrived, he was greeted by a raging firestorm. A sizeable portion of the land was burning, but there were no enemy forces in sight.",
      "A Sun Solstice Warrior had turned evil.",
      "Hiding somewhere on the island, he would come out once a day to deplete his powers, slowly burning away at the landscape.",
      "Thanks to the trail of conflagration, he was easily tracked.",
      "Their fight persisted for days on end, but for all his might, Duke Aventry was unable to defeat the evil Solstice Warrior.",
      "Seeing the collateral damage caused by their battle, he accepted they were at a stalemate and retreated, in order to avoid further destruction of his already bleeding land.",
      "Struck by despair in the face of his inability to protect his people, Duke Aventry let his guard down, and in walked the enemy.",
      "Fleshmancer Acolyte Two approached in disguise, and offered him a magic shard.",
      "“This ancient shard was made by the Ovates themselves,” she lied, fully aware of Duke Aventry's weakened state of mind.",
      "“It will shroud your island in complete darkness for one day, blocking all light from the sun and moon.”",
      "“My enemy's powers would...” he mused, “But...”",
      "Playing to Duke Aventry's sense of honor, Two gave him the final nudge: “The Solstice Warrior hasn't been playing by the rules, either.”",
      "“Surely you wish to protect your people?” she asked.",
      "Duke Aventry accepted the shard and thanked her for her help.",
      "“Simply smash the shard with conviction, and its magic will awaken.” Two explained on her way out.",
      "He wasted no time in smashing the shard, and by voluntarily activating the curse on his island, played right into the Acolytes' hands.",
      "Everything went fine at first. The Night Shroud covered the land, and Duke Aventry made short work of the weakened Solstice Warrior.",
      "As celebrations began, they put out a call for wind mages to gather waves strong enough to flood the eastern part the island.",
      "The flames were extinguished at last, but in doing so, those areas were transformed into the famous swamps we know today.",
      "It was a change welcomed by all, for it came hand in hand with their victory.",
      "It took a few weeks until it became clear to all that The Night Shroud would never recede.",
      "Despite overwhelming support from his people, Duke Aventry could not forgive himself for his mistake.",
      "Finally realizing who had really given him the magic shard, he departed for the Clockwork Castle.",
      "On that day, Duke Aventry played into the Acolytes' hands for the second time.",
      "While he was away, Fleshmancer Acolyte Three infiltrated Aventry Manor and killed Ewilda.",
      "Thus was the ritual completed, and a Seed of Evil was planted in the mansion which, a few centuries later, would grow into the Dweller of Woe.",
      "Completely defeated, over the following days Duke Aventry died of sadness and despair.",
      "As if fate hadn't been cruel enough, over two hundred years later, Romaya found his urn and raised him from the dead to be her bodyguard.",
      "For decades, the Duke roamed the swamps he once ruled over, his memory completely gone, feeling nothing save for an unexplainable sadness.",
      "In bouts of clarity, he would feel a brief but very deep yearning for something he just couldn't put his finger on.",
      "Such was the Duke's lot for half a century until, one day, young Solstice Warriors reclaimed Ewilda's locket and brought it to him.",
      "His memory now restored, Duke Aventry smashed the locket, and in doing so broke the tether binding his soul to the material plane.",
      "At long last, he found peace and was free to leave this world.",
      "The end.",
      "Of the many events from the time of the Ovates, many consider the foundation of the Kingdom in the Clouds to be the most significant.",
      "It was back in the early days, when the world was still being shaped.",
      "Once they had completed the islands, they started working on the travel golems.",
      "The Ovates first built Y'eet and X'tol, and rejoiced at the ease with which they could activate them using power words.",
      "But for Mesa Island, something more was needed. A sentient golem. One that would not simply obey commands, but carry purpose.",
      "The reason was that this specific island was at sea level, but as the Ovates had seen in their dreams, it needed to be propped up way higher.",
      "Indeed, in the future there would be a great flood, and for this world to survive, Mesa Island would have to remain above water.",
      "Although that future was a very distant one, the Ovates remained as selfless as ever in their dedication to harmony and balance.",
      "Thus they built Khukharr, but alas, found themselves unable to give it sentience.",
      "Ever embracing the flow of things, the Ovates held firm to the belief that their part in saving Mesa Island had been played.",
      "They moved on to completing the vision they had seen in a shared dream, and from the essence of the very clouds, conjured the Sky Giants.",
      "There would come a time when the Ovates would go extinct, and it would fall to the Sky Giants to keep watch.",
      "They would be tasked with establishing a council in the clouds to oversee three very important things.",
      "First of which was to keep watch over the elements. While the flood was unavoidable, maintaining balance would remain a challenge unless new Ovates arose.",
      "Secondly, they would be the gatekeepers of the Sea of Stars, carefully vetting those who would seek to travel between worlds.",
      "Lastly, there was the matter of Khukharr.",
      "It remained incomplete, and so they would need to be on the lookout for a wielder of magic potent enough to make the construct sentient.",
      "In the end, it was The Great Eagle who helped them in this.",
      "Nowadays, few are aware of Khukharr's purpose, most believing it to be nothing more than an impressive feat of masonry.",
      "And even from a prophetic standpoint, there is no real way to know whether it will withstand the coming flood.",
      "But until then, Khukharr's role would remain a passive one.",
      "Holding on with an ever-firm grip, it would stand tall, inspiring mortals as a testament to stoicism and true dedication.",
      "One need only lay eyes upon the construct once to understand where it got its title of Khukharr the Unyielding.",
      "The end.",
      "When the birdmen accepted Aephorul's deal, he knew that granting their species access to mind magic would be easy for him.",
      "There was only the matter of giving them their own god to worship.",
      "And so as always, when a problem wouldn't also serve to advance his research, he delegated.",
      "The Songsters were capable builders. Not as tech-savvy as the humans who built Sky Base, but he just needed a giant construct--and no tricks.",
      "With proper incentives in place in the form of hostages, Aephorul put T'kor in charge.",
      "A team was formed and together they started building the Sacrosanct Spires, with its pretend god as the centerpiece: the giant, Es'tristae.",
      "But T'kor was no fool--he knew all too well that Aephorul wouldn't stop until every single shred of life had been exploited or corrupted.",
      "On the third night, the Songsters performed a ritual chant to summon a vision of the distant future to T'kor's mind...",
      "...Sky Base, the regulator of climate, corrupted. The death of all fauna and flora...",
      "...The megacity completely razed, his land reduced to an ocean of blue sand...",
      "...The tech-savvy humans, their souls detached from their bodies, and tethered to cyborgs by a wicked machine...",
      "...Forced to live in despair, their minds food for a growing sea monster...",
      "...A world without sun, without hope--and the moon, sunken into the abyssal depths...",
      "...And his own people... What cruel fate...",
      "...Heroes of the future, this world's only hope, capable yet without any means to reach Sky Base, with power offline...",
      "The vision faded and T'kor focused his mind on dreaming a sanguine dream.",
      "The next morning, he woke up with purpose--when the time came, the heroes would have the spark needed to reclaim their world.",
      "The solution had to be so simple, it would be invisible to Aephorul and his elitist mind.",
      "And so they built Es'tristae on a vertical power rail connected to the planet's grid.",
      "For the final touch, they raised an enormous slab of stone for the giant statue to hold firmly in its hands.",
      "The most primitive form of battery which, when dropped, would grind on the rail and return power to the grid.",
      "Their plan worked--Aephorul wrote it off as a purely artistic choice.",
      "Centuries went by, and with the rise of The Fleshmancer, the world lay helpless as T'kor's visions of suffering and destruction came to be.",
      "All the while Es'tristae stood there, never getting so much as a second look from Aephorul.",
      "For centuries and more, the fail-safe was hidden in plain sight, ready to support the heroes of the future in their last-ditch effort to reclaim this world.",
      "While T'kor wouldn't live to see the day of their arrival, he died knowing that his world, and his people, at least stood a chance.",
      "The end.",
      "This one is special--it's an adventurer's log! Might want to take some notes.",
      "“Joce's log - Cerulean Expedition Day 1.",
      "“I wasn't expecting to feel fear so early on.",
      "“To think we might just happen upon her... The Queen That Was...",
      "“Still, she needs to be found, lest she get the jump on Repine.",
      "“Even the sunken moon knows we've suffered enough from her betrayal as it is.",
      "“Three teams, we are. The other two are led by Brochu and Elbi.",
      "“Plan goes like this: Each team has a series of four directions to explore.",
      "“Four directions, four days. After which, we backtrack for another four and compare notes.",
      "“Brochu's team is trying northeast, southeast, south, then northwest.",
      "“Elbi's team is going southwest, south, southwest, then east.",
      "“As for my team, we're doing north, east, northeast, then south.",
      "“Joce's log - Cerulean Expedition Day 9.",
      "“Well I'll be damned. It was obvious once I took a second look at the notes.",
      "“Brochu said it felt right for the first two days, but then something was amiss.",
      "“Elbi recounted feeling lost the whole time, save for Day 4 where everyone had more spring in their step.",
      "“As for me, I was right, Day 3 was truly special.",
      "“That speedball ought to lead to her throne, but it lost power like all the others, so there ain't no way forward.",
      "“And seeing as I lost my entire team getting here, so there ain't a way back either. That's it for me, I guess.",
      "“If you're reading this, you must have found my belongings.",
      "“Well then, let it be known: Joce was here.\"",
