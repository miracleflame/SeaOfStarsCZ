      "What? But how, then?",
      "Hoo! That is why you must use magic without using magic!",
      "The trials await. Godspeed!",
      "That attack did nothing!",
      "And we can't use spells here...",
      "...",
      "Look! Some <color=magic>little orbs</color> appeared when you attacked.",

      "Could be, I feel a kind of pull towards them.",
      "Might as well lean into it. Let's see.",
      "Whoa!!!",
      "It worked! How does it feel?",

      "Whether you are dealing with an intricate lock pattern, need to make your next healing spell really count, or just want to deal more damage, remember to boost!",
      "Hoo hoo hoo...",
      "The preparations are complete. It seems you understand the power of Live Mana.",
