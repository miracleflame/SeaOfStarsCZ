      "We made it! Time to stop for a snack.",
      "What? I'm not hungry.",
      "We just left a few minutes ago.",
      "Look, it's not a real adventure if you don't eat a snack on the road.",
      "Plus, I made something special for the occasion.",
      "Here!",
      "Wow, that's really good!",
      "No kidding.",
      "Glad you like it.",
      "It's the jam. I used a bit of sap from the <color=magic>Celestial Willow</color>.",
      "You could get in trouble for that.",
      "Only if you tell.",
      "Alright, how do I do this?",
      "Maybe like Erlina showed me?",
      "Try opening your palm and concentrating.",
      "You got this, Valere!",
      "I KNEW IT!!!",
      "I did it...",
      "I FINALLY DID IT!!!",
      "So... what now?",
      "The Headmaster must have heard the bell ring.",
      "Should we just wait for him?",
      "Might as well enter, it can be our first adventure!",
      "And then the Headmaster will know we're NOT afraid!",
      "Let's show him!",
      "Come on, [MAINCHAR], I want to see the cavern!",
      "Careful, there's monsters over there!",
      "I thought Evermist Island was safe.",
      "Guess that's only true for Mooncradle...",
      "They look dangerous. We should have waited outside.",
      "You're right. Come on.",
      "It's blocking our path!",
      "We have to fight. In position!",
      "We're not ready for this...",
      "It's preparing another attack!",
      "[MAINCHAR], watch out!",
      "AAAAAHHHHHGGGG!",
      "NO!!!",
      "My eye!!",
      "GARL!!!",
      "It really hurts...",
      "I... I can't see...",
      "There's no escape...",
      "We shouldn't have come here...",
      "So it was you...",
      "As resourceful as you are reckless, I see.",
      "Headmaster! Garl needs help!",
      "It... feels better...",
      "What Garl needs is to not concern himself with the affairs of the Solstice Warriors!",
      "I'm really sorry, Headmaster. It was all my idea...",
      "Hey!",
      "Be thankful that the only cost of this lesson was an eye, young lad.",
      "As for the two of you, if you are so eager to receive training, I shall oblige.",
      "Follow me.",
      "And you always wanted to be like Moyara.",
      "Over twenty Solstice Warriors died that day, and what, we just move on?",
      "I was dumb. I don't want to be a hero anymore.",
      "I never wanted to be one...",
      "And no matter what I do, Moraine always says I'm not fast enough. I just feel awful.",
      "I know, Brugaves...",
      "If there's a way out, I'll find it for us.",
      "Well, I'm cold...",
      "And I'm hungry.",
      "We're helpless...",
      "Alright, let's go back.",
      "Back to learning magic. Yay.",
      "Sure feels easier now.",
      "This time we make it through.",
      "The device is broken. Can't activate the bridge.",
      "There's an opening there, maybe we can go around.",
      "Valere?",
      "Sounds big. Get ready!",
      "OUR FIRST BIG ONE!",
      "Haha! We did it!",
      "Looks like there's a way out, over there.",
      "The Elder Mist's mountain shouldn't be much further now.",
      "[MAINCHAR], there's a <color=magic>campfire</color> spot here. We should rest a little to heal up while we can.",
      "It's locked.",
      "Maybe the key is in the chest just up there?",
      "It's out of reach for now. Let's look around.",
      "Hey, this glowing scroll looks powerful. We should check it out.",
      "Use the scroll from your inventory to learn the new combo.",
      "After spending a decade in training, [MAINCHAR] and [OFFCHAR] begin their journey towards the Mountain Trail, where they are to seek out an ancient seer known as the <color=good>Elder Mist</color>..."
