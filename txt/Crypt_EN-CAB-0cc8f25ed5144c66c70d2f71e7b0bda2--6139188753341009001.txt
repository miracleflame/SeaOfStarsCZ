   [309]
    1 string data = "That's why the well suited him so perfectly. A place to hide, where he could be alone with his stories, with no one to mock or judge him."
   [310]
    1 string data = "It was a safe life, unfortunately devoid of purpose, but at least shielded from rejection."
   [311]
    1 string data = "Over the years, he made friends who helped him climb out, and helped him build his stories to share them with the world."
   [312]

   [313]
    1 string data = "And that, in short, is where this story ended five years ago."
   [314]
    1 string data = "A lot has happened since then, and this journey wouldn't feel whole without some closure, so here we go. Cloak on, mask off."

   [317]
    1 string data = "It had festered into a false promise. That with enough effort, something would rise from the ashes at long last."
   [318]
    1 string data = "A belief that the entire world just might be enough for two people to finally see that all along, they'd had someone worth welcoming, worth accepting."
   [319]
    1 string data = "But how would that even play out, exactly?"
   [320]
    1 string data = "Learning about the notion of healing fantasies completely floored him. His situation ticked all the boxes."

   [343]
    1 string data = "And of course, video games. He finally understood what they had been to him. A sanctuary."
   [344]
    1 string data = "The place where he could be free. Free to experiment, to learn, to ask, to fail, to persevere, to give up, to overcome, to laugh, to accomplish, to dream."

    1 string data = "He wasn't just a response, he was someone who understood how to build a sanctuary, and who knew what it was like to need one."

   [351]
    1 string data = "And at long last he knew that everything he needed, he already possessed. His friends were there with him."
   [352]
    1 string data = "They always had been. This whole journey was one of genuine expression of their personalities and of their unbelievable chemistry."
   [353]
    1 string data = "With all thoughts of destruction now gone, he set out to complete the project with the intention to create without any hope of recognition."

   [355]

   [356]
