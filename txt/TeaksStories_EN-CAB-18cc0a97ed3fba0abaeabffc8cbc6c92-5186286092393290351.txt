   [95]
    1 string data = "After much struggle, Resh'an discovered the flesh minions' only weaknesses to be Solar and Lunar magic--a power bestowed upon those born during a solstice."
   [96]
    1 string data = "He began training these children to become Solstice Warriors, singularly tasked with culling the numbers of The Fleshmancer's creations."
   [97]
    1 string data = "But Aephorul's knowledge was also growing. Eventually, he became capable of creating oddities of unlimited potential, known as Dwellers."
   [98]
    1 string data = "They would be impervious to all forms of magic--except during a total eclipse, when Solstice Warriors would have a very short window to attempt taking them down."
   [99]
    1 string data = "And Dwellers, it turned out, were creatures in development feeding on local life."
   [100]
    1 string data = "Left to their own devices for too long, they would evolve into World Eaters, spelling doom for all."
   [101]
    1 string data = "Armed with knowledge and power, Solstice Warriors would patrol the world, tracking Dwellers to determine which should be taken down during the next eclipse."
   [102]
    1 string data = "If they remained vigilant, there would never be a World Eater, but Resh'an knew such a stalemate would only cause Aephorul to devise something even worse."
   [103]
    1 string data = "In a desperate attempt to get ahead, Resh'an boldly performed transmutation alchemy on the very space-time continuum itself."
   [104]
    1 string data = "After successfully splitting reality into countless timelines and parallel worlds, he shelved his alchemy vial and took up the mantle of Archivist."
   [105]
    1 string data = "On an endless journey across all realities, he would catalog every possible outcome in search of a resolution to the throes of the Fleshmancer."
   [106]
    1 string data = "Meanwhile, Aephorul rejoiced at the infinite number of opportunities for destruction that had just opened up to him."
   [107]
    1 string data = "To find some measure of peace amidst their immortal conflict, the two alchemists made a pact to let the fate of each timeline play out on its own."
   [108]
    1 string data = "And so the game of cat and mouse began, played by Dwellers and Solstice Warriors on one level, and by Resh'an and Aephorul on another."
   [109]
    1 string data = "Across a myriad of timelines and over innumerous centuries, some worlds would never be visited by Aephorul, while others would be cursed by his mark."
   [110]
    1 string data = "Once marked, it was only a matter of time until a world met its finality, often following centuries of struggle."
   [111]
    1 string data = "Each would either be destroyed by a World Eater, or permanently saved by the ascension of a pair of Solstice Warriors into Guardian Gods."
   [112]
    1 string data = "As to when Resh'an plans on recomposing the timelines, or whether he even knows how, remains to be seen."
   [113]
    1 string data = "The end."
   [114]
    1 string data = "It was as compelling as invitations could get."
   [115]
    1 string data = "All of the best artisans the world over received it: a personalized letter signed by the mysterious Great Eagle."
   [116]
    1 string data = "Enclosed were directions, along with the promise of a worthwhile endeavor and a touch of magic."
   [117]
    1 string data = "They gathered en masse on the barren island to the southwest, hoping to meet the mysterious "Great Eagle” who had signed their invitations."
   [118]
    1 string data = "But all they found when they arrived were three vials, two of which were sealed."
   [119]
    1 string data = "When they opened the first vial, it became clear to all that there was even more to the Great Eagle than what the stories had shared."
   [120]
    1 string data = "As the cork was removed, a solar eclipse occurred and magical light flew in from above the sky, reshaping the peninsula into a crescent."
   [121]
    1 string data = "At the end of its dance, the light coalesced on the cliffside and gave birth to a tree so beautiful it appeared to belong in a dream."
   [122]
    1 string data = "The Celestial Willow rose up while the grass turned to its signature purple hue."
   [123]
    1 string data = "As if the magic had spoken directly to their minds, the builders knew exactly what they had to do."
   [124]
    1 string data = "They would build the town of Mooncradle, and hold a festival by the Celestial Willow twice a year, in expectation of the Great Eagle's visit."
   [125]
    1 string data = "Unless they happened to be born in Mooncradle, Children of the Solstice would never know their real parents."
   [126]
    1 string data = "So that no one would feel different or rejected, Mooncradle was built around one core tenet: community."
   [127]
    1 string data = "They built a common dormitory for everyone, along with a single shared dining hall."
   [128]
    1 string data = "Zenith Academy was also clearly visible in all of their minds. They built it, but had no idea how to give it its final touch."
   [129]
    1 string data = "That was when the second vial uncorked itself."
   [130]
    1 string data = "Glowing runes flew out and embedded themselves into Zenith Academy's foundation, enchanting it with levitation magic. The School in the Sky was born."
   [131]
    1 string data = "As if to celebrate the builders' efforts, the third seal was undone, and out of the tiny vial flowed a seemingly endless stream of mist."
   [132]
    1 string data = "It permeated Evermist Island, giving it its name. In the end, a peculiar voice spoke to their minds."
   [133]
    1 string data = "The voice provided guidelines for the education of Solstice Warriors, and stressed the importance of seeking out "The Elder Mist" once their training was complete."
   [134]
    1 string data = "As the voice grew faint, the three vials disappeared."
   [135]
    1 string data = "Since that day, the people of Mooncradle have held the festival to welcome Children of the Solstice, taking it upon themselves to nurture them until they come of age."

   [141]
    1 string data = "In The Fleshmancer's new base of operations, they would toil away, creating machines for obscure uses in realms unknown."
   [142]
    1 string data = "But such a base had yet to be built, so as always Aephorul set out to locate the best collaborator there was to be found."
   [143]
    1 string data = "He needed someone morally neutral--for it was execution he desired, not competition."
   [144]
    1 string data = "With this new lair, he would prove himself superior to Resh'an by building a castle that would control time within itself."
   [145]
    1 string data = "The Watchmaker was the perfect fit. She was only interested in her craft, and otherwise had no interest in Aephorul's machinations."

   [150]
    1 string data = "Construction was almost complete when Caël and his crew made their move."
   [151]
    1 string data = "One night, they flipped exactly the right cogs so that once the castle's perpetual movement was activated, its core function would backfire."
   [152]
    1 string data = "They had no goal in mind other than foiling The Fleshmancer's plans, and in that respect, they'd succeeded resoundingly."
   [153]
    1 string data = "What came of the sabotage was that time now came to a halt within the Clockwork Castle, or rather, within its inhabitants."
   [154]
    1 string data = "And they had played their trick so well, that Aephorul didn't even know they'd done it on purpose."
   [155]
    1 string data = "There would be no impressing Resh'an this time, but he could definitely see some upsides to a workshop that operated forever."
   [156]
    1 string data = "As a final touch, he ensured that any mortal leaving the castle would see themselves age instantly by the amount of time they'd spent inside."
   [157]
    1 string data = "Upon completion, Aephorul locked everyone inside for a century, ensuring that The Watchmaker and the children could never leave, lest they die instantly of old age."

   [160]
    1 string data = "Proud of having done the right thing, it seems they are at peace with their situation. Perhaps getting to be kids forever helps, in a way."
   [161]
    1 string data = "From day one they would always deliver, while adding just the right amount of breakage to give The Fleshmancer countless headaches without raising suspicion."
   [162]

    1 string data = "Why them? And with the current Oracle of Tides being so young, who could confirm the long-awaited discovery?"
   [167]
    1 string data = "But in their heart of hearts they knew--before them, appearing even more vividly than in their visions, stood the Tower of Antsudlo."
   [168]
    1 string data = "And so it was that The Nomads of the Sea, who had traversed abyssal plains since time immemorial, would settle at long last."
