   [121]
    1 string data = "Let me take over. I can give them the perfect protector they deserve, without the weakness, without the doubt."
   [122]
    1 string data = "You know it's true. Deep down, you don't think you belong. So why not step aside? I can handle it."
   [123]
    1 string data = "And yet you resist. Still holding yourself back, always playing the calm and controlled hero."
   [124]
    1 string data = "But you crave to let it all go. You need only accept my offer, and I'll be everything you couldn't be… Everything you wouldn't let yourself be."
   [125]
    1 string data = "Just imagine, no more struggle, no more restraint."
   [126]
    1 string data = "I guess you were right, in a way. For a long time, I thought I had to be the brightest light in the room…"
   [127]
    1 string data = "I thought that if people didn't see me as strong, I was failing them. And myself."
   [128]
    1 string data = "That's right. Doesn't it feel good to finally just give in?"
   [129]
    1 string data = "Come closer."
   [130]
    1 string data = "No. That's where you're wrong. I don't need your empty pride, or for anyone to tell me what I'm worth."
   [131]
    1 string data = "You're lying to yourself again, Zale. Without me, you're just another child with no spark. I am the greatness you crave!"
   [132]
    1 string data = "You're nothing but a shadow of my fears… and I'm done letting you control me."
   [133]
    1 string data = "What!? How dare you!?"
   [134]
    1 string data = "The weakness you exploited... I see it now. I was afraid of what might be hiding in the shadows. In my own mind."
   [135]
    1 string data = "I know you've thought about it. To be wild, to stop pretending. I see it in your eyes, Valere. You want me to take the burden from you."
   [136]
    1 string data = "All I feared was that if I let go even for a moment, I'd lose myself, just like you did. "
   [137]
    1 string data = "But I understand now that I don't have to choose between peace and strength."
   [138]
    1 string data = "No! I am your better half! BEND THE KNEE!"
   [139]
    1 string data = "You're not better than me, or anyone. You're just my doubt, dressed up as a king."
   [140]
    1 string data = "I am not… enough!?"
   [141]
    1 string data = "But you're weak, Valere! Your peace is just a cage. Let it go, give in to the power you're hiding, and you'll be unstoppable!"
   [142]
    1 string data = "You're the weak one. No discipline, only jealousy and anger. I don't need you to become whole. You're the one that needs to be freed."
   [143]
    1 string data = "But…"
   [144]
    1 string data = "We let them haunt us..."
   [145]
    1 string data = "We were so scared of what we might be hiding..."
   [146]
    1 string data = "No more. And never again."
