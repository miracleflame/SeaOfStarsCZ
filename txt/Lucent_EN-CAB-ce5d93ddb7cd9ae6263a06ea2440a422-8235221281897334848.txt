   [133]
    1 string data = "How can we get there?"
   [134]
    1 string data = "East of Lucent is a <color=good>Ferryman</color> who will take us across the bog if we play our cards right."

   [154]
    1 string data = "You're one to talk with your “Bulwark of the innocents” thing, I'm so glad you gave that up."
   [155]
    1 string data = "To be fair, we did help a bunch of people already."
   [156]

   [160]
    1 string data = "What do you mean?"
   [161]
    1 string data = "I don't understand it, it was like a floodgate opened in the pit of my stomach."
   [162]
    1 string data = "Like when we were first learning magic?"
   [163]
    1 string data = "Sort of, but... way, way stronger."
   [164]
    1 string data = "Do you think it was the Dweller?"
   [165]
    1 string data = "No, it didn't feel evil, or even bad."
   [166]
    1 string data = "A response to seeing Garl in danger..."
   [167]
    1 string data = "But I couldn't let it in, I feared it would overwhelm me."

   [171]
    1 string data = "Zale, we're all safe now. That's all that matters."
   [172]
    1 string data = "I think that was my prophecy."
   [173]
    1 string data = "What do you mean?"
   [174]
    1 string data = "The Elder Mist, he told me I had potential but first needed to “stare at the night inside of me.”"
   [175]
    1 string data = "I think this is what he meant... The thought of losing a loved one."
   [176]
    1 string data = "I felt the power but I couldn't actualize it..."
   [177]
    1 string data = "I wouldn't overthink it. Prophecies are not swayed by the attention we give them."
   [178]
    1 string data = "Aren't you curious about yours?"
   [179]
    1 string data = "He said I might be able to “create paths on water.” What does that even mean?"
   [180]
    1 string data = "Yeah, talk about cryptic..."
   [181]
    1 string data = "The way I look at it, it's going to happen or not, no matter how much sleep I lose over it."
   [182]
    1 string data = "..."
   [183]
    1 string data = "You have such a relaxed outlook. I wish I was born on the winter solstice too."
   [184]

   [185]
    1 string data = "I suppose you and I even each other out, in a way."

    1 string data = "That's part of why we make a good team."
   [187]
    1 string data = "I guess..."
   [188]

    1 string data = "Well..."
   [201]
    1 string data = "Whoa! You mean she could kind of teleport?"
   [202]
