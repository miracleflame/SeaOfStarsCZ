   [115]
    1 string data = "Every Docarri house has an inner chamber. We come up to the part above the surface when we want to socialize."
   [116]

   [117]
    1 string data = "Don't be shy now!"
   [118]
    1 string data = "Some Docarri prefer to remain in their inner chambers most of the time."
   [119]
    1 string data = "As a tribe we learned not to take offense at such behavior, and to celebrate each community member's freedom to engage and associate to the extent that they desire."

    1 string data = "Our tribe comes from <color=location>The Deep Blue</color>, far below the ocean floor."
   [121]
    1 string data = "As aquatic nomads, we followed the guidance of the Oracle of Tides for generations, establishing encampments ever closer to the surface."
   [122]
    1 string data = "As you can see, we eventually made it to our destination! After Docarri Village was founded, we abandoned our nomadic way of life."
   [123]
    1 string data = "I love hanging out here, there's something about diving into the water and climbing back out only to dive in again that never loses its appeal."
   [124]
    1 string data = "It's like an endless vacation!"
   [125]
    1 string data = "It doesn't beat fresh water, but fresh air isn't bad."
   [126]
    1 string data = "Us Docarri have a particular relationship with water, which our sensitive skin feels as very enveloping. It keeps us calm and composed."
   [127]
    1 string data = "If we spend too much time outside of a body of water, we are compelled by anxiety to find that comfort again."
   [128]
    1 string data = "Each of us have their own threshold, some preferring to remain in their inner chambers at all times."
   [129]
    1 string data = "You're welcome to visit them by using the water vortexes. Even though they are often forgotten, the more sensitive types have as much need for connection as anyone."
   [130]
    1 string data = "North of here is the dreadful mountain known as <color=bad>Torment Peak</color>."
   [131]

   [132]
    1 string data = "Which makes me wonder, how can something be so dreadful that even they would run from it...?"
   [133]
    1 string data = "Welp, now I'm scared."
   [134]
    1 string data = "While some of us can wield a trident with relative efficiency, we are not a tribe of warriors."

   [138]
    1 string data = "You bet!"
   [139]
    1 string data = "Woah!"
   [140]
    1 string data = "I thought Wheels would be hard to get a grasp of, but I just played a couple of games and it all made sense."

   [142]
    1 string data = "Hey, you emptied my stocks! What a fruitful collaboration this was!"
   [143]

    1 string data = "That's MARKET OF MARVELS! Grandpa left me a whole bunch of items and relics--up for grabs to whoever helps me grow my Rainbow Conch collection!"
   [150]
    1 string data = "Sounds fun. Where can we find them?"
   [151]
    1 string data = "Around! Though Rainbow Conches are all the rage as of late, so the easy ones are mostly gone. Just need to keep your eyes peeled for secret areas."
   [152]
    1 string data = "Some people might be swayed into giving theirs up, too!"
   [153]
    1 string data = "You seem to know a lot for your age."
   [154]
    1 string data = "Business is a game of MUTUAL BENEFIT and LEVERAGE."
   [155]
    1 string data = "I did my homework. I know you won't be able to resist schematics to build a tavern and a fishing house in that town you founded."
   [156]
    1 string data = "What's that? You'd prefer EPIC LOOT like <color=magic>Relics</color>? You've come to the right place, Solstice Warriors!"
   [157]
    1 string data = "See? MUTUAL BENEFIT--you work for me, and my Rainbow Conch collection will be unbeatable!"
   [158]
    1 string data = "Haha! You sure have the drive."
   [159]
    1 string data = "Question is, do YOU have the RAINBOW CONCHES?"
   [160]

   [178]
    1 string data = "It's my <color=good>three grandkids</color>. They wanted to play hide and seek, and, well, I simply cannot find them."
   [179]
    1 string data = "They have a habit of hiding in random inner chambers, and being from an older generation I find myself quite unwilling to barge into other people's homes."
   [180]
